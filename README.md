# kdev (MVP)

A lightweight Go-CLI that spins up, attaches to and cleans up **devpods** (dev container in Kubernetes).
It wraps arround `kubectl` and renders a simple Pod-template. RBAC, non-root, PVC - everything you enjoy. ðŸ˜Ž

## Install
```bash
go install ./...
# eller
go build -o kdev
```

## Use
```bash
# Create devpod
./kdev up --name mydev --image registry.local/your/devimage:latest -n dev --env FOO=bar --cpu 1000m --memory 2Gi

# List dev pods
./kdev ls -n dev

# Attach
./kdev attach --name mydev -n dev

# Delete pod (Also remove the pvc as long as it's name is the same as the pods name)
./kdev rm --name mydev -n dev --with-pvc
```

## Devcontainer build

kdev supports building images from a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file. The command requires either an explicit image name or both a registry and tag. Example:

```bash
# provide registry and tag (image will be <registry>/<name>:<tag>)
./kdev devcontainer build --registry harbor.example.com --tag v1.2.3 --push

# or provide a full image name (including registry and tag)
./kdev devcontainer build --image harbor.example.com/myproj/devcontainer:v1.2.3 --push
```

Flags:
- `--image` â€” override the full image name (can include registry and tag)
- `--registry` and `--tag` â€” used together to construct image name when `--image` is not provided
- `--push` â€” push the image after a successful build


## kubeconfig requirement

kdev uses the Kubernetes API (client-go) and therefore needs access to a kubeconfig file to talk to your cluster. By default it will look for kubeconfig at `~/.kube/config` using the normal kube rules.

If your kubeconfig is elsewhere, set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or point `kubectl`/client-go to a different file before running kdev. Example:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig
./kdev ls -n dev
```

Alternatively use your normal kubectl context configuration (the same kubeconfig locations are honored).

Note: Previously kdev wrapped `kubectl`; the current implementation uses the Kubernetes client library directly and needs a valid kubeconfig to authenticate and connect.


## Template-variable
`templates/pod.yaml` supports these placeholders:
`{{NAME}} {{NAMESPACE}} {{IMAGE}} {{SERVICE_ACCOUNT}} {{PVC_NAME}} {{WORKDIR}} {{CPU}} {{MEMORY}} {{SHELL}} {{LABELS_EXTRA}} {{ENVS}} {{NODE_SELECTOR}} {{STORAGE_CLASS}} {{STORAGE_SIZE}}`
